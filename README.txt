		================
		
This application allows the user export any ARCS chart's data from the base CD, 
to a compress zip file.
User will be requested to browse and select the ARCS Base CD folder and import 
chart's ID to export. Then once "Create" is clicked, a compressed .zip file is
created at the same directory, as the ARCS Base CD, titled  with ARCS chart ID
number, eg "ARCS_0000".
The exported file may then be send to the customer/vessel, to dicompress and 
install on vessel's ECDIS.

The application is developed in Python programming language.
